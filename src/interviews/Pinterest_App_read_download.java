	/**
	 * We want you to write a more intelligent web scraper that will help us
	 * grab some of the following information for sites of your choice:
	 * 
	 * Prices 
	 * Number of Items Available 
	 * Seller Information 
	 * Tags 
	 * Product Rating
	 * Product Details 
	 * Product Title
	 * 
	 * This could work on sites such as Etsy, Amazon, Gap, or other sites of
	 * your choice.
	 * 
	 * Your Code: Please write a small application that can read a csv of urls
	 * and images from a file.
	 * 
	 * For each url and image link it will download the image into a sub
	 * directory and store its own json blob file of information for the urls.
	 * The schema is up to you, but it should try to be as consistent for
	 * different sites as possible
