	/**
	 * Goal: Write a function get_related_pins that takes a pin_id and returns a
	 * list of related pin_ids. Note that doing a good job on this challenge is
	 * as much about setting up good data structures and decomposing code
	 * cleanly as about clever data mining techniques.
	 * 
	 * Data: board_json.txt and pin_json.txt are text files of JSON-encoded
	 * dictionaries of board and pin object data, respectively. There is data
	 * for ~300k pins and ~10k boards, with possible duplicates.
	 * 
	 * Each board JSON dict contains the fields id, user_id, username, name,
	 * slug, description, and category (which may be null, but if not, is one of
	 * a fixed set of categories). Each pin JSON dict contains the fields id,
	 * board_id, user_id, img_url, is_repin, is_video, source, and link.
	 * 
	 * To get the data into a format that is easy to work with, consider using a
	 * lightweight database system like SQLite.
